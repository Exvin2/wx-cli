## Active Feature Testing

### Design System Components
Tested DesignSystem class with modern UI elements:
- Headings (3 levels)
- Bullet points
- Badges (success, warning, error)
- Progress indicators
- Separators
- Clean layouts without Panel borders

**Result**: ✓ All components working with soft colors and minimal design

### Hurricane Tracking
Tested active storm display and Saffir-Simpson scale:
- No active storms currently (expected for October)
- Scale display shows all 6 categories correctly
- Color coding: cyan → yellow → red → magenta by severity

**Result**: ✓ Working correctly

### Multi-Location Dashboard
Tested 3 modes with UK cities (London, Manchester, Birmingham):

**Compare Mode**:
- Creates clean Rich table with 6 metrics
- Temperature, feels-like, conditions, wind, humidity, precip
- Shows temperature range across locations

**Travel Mode**:
- Compares home vs. destination
- Provides packing recommendations

**Trending Mode**:
- Rankings: warmest, coolest, highest rain chance
- Top 3 locations for each metric

**Result**: ✓ All 3 modes working perfectly

### Notification System
Tested alert rule management:
- Add rule: ✓ (created "freeze" rule for London)
- List rules: ✓ (displays rule with condition, location, method)
- Rule evaluation: ✓ (triggered 3/3 rules with test data)
- Severity detection: ✓ (critical for temp < 0, warning for wind > 50)

**Result**: ✓ Complete notification system working

### Radar Station Database
Tested NOAA RIDGE radar network:
- Total stations: 137
- Sample stations verified (KVNX, KBLX, KGRK, KILX, KRAX)
- Station metadata includes location names

**Result**: ✓ Complete radar station coverage

### Lightning Strike Data
Tested strike generation and tracking:
- Generated 16 synthetic strikes
- Data includes: lat, lon, time, intensity (kA), type (IC/CG/CC)
- Strike types correctly classified

**Result**: ✓ Lightning data system working

### Air Quality Systems
**US EPA AQI** (6-level scale):
- PM2.5: 78 (Moderate)
- O3: 55 (Moderate)
- Categories: Good, Moderate, Unhealthy for Sensitive, Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy, Hazardous

   - Offline mode provides synthetic data for testing

2. **Radar Display**:
   - Unicode mode works in all terminals
   - Kitty graphics requires Kitty terminal
   - Sixel requires compatible terminal
   - GUI mode opens external window

3. **International Coverage**:
   - Currently supports: UK (Met Office), Canada (Environment Canada)
   - Future expansion possible: Germany (DWD), Australia (BOM), etc.

## Recommendations

### For UK User (Primary Use Case)
1. Get Met Office API key: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/datapoint
2. Set environment variable: `export METOFFICE_API_KEY=your_key`
3. Use commands:
   - `wx international London` - UK-specific weather
   - `wx aqi London --region UK` - UK air quality (DAQI scale)
   - `wx dashboard London Manchester Edinburgh` - Compare UK cities
   - `wx notify add freeze "temp < 0" London` - Set freeze alerts

### General Usage
- Default mode: `wx` or `wx --offline` (worldview)
- Severe weather: `wx --severe` (filter critical alerts)
- Hurricane season: `wx hurricanes --scale --map`
- Travel planning: `wx dashboard London Paris --mode travel`
